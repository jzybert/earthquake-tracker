Notes for our presentation in class:

We'll explain what our app does:
- we built an earthquake tracker app which allows for users to query dates and
  longitude/latitude to see what earthquakes occurred within those parameters
- any data retrieved is shown in both a table and a Google Map
- users can also specify areas they want tracked and receive email updates
  about those areas
- News tab which displays news about earthquakes

What we want to show for live demo:
- show a query of the USGS database using dates/ranges
  - click on some pins to show earthquakes
- show a tracked area
- show the news tab

Talk about libraries and tools we used:
- HTTPoison and Poison (for APIs and parsing)
- SMTP and Mailjet (for email)
- News API (for earthquake news)
- Google Maps API (for displaying earthquake pins)

Some challenges we faced:
- working with unfamiliar APIs
- getting email working
- broadcasting news to users
